### Chapter 1 – Getting Started (Example)

**Summary:**  
Introduction to Rust, installing tools, and running basic programs.

**Key Concepts:**

- Rust provides modern developer tools for systems programming:
    
    - Cargo (dependency management and build tool)
        
    - rustfmt (code formatting tool)
        
    - Rust Language Server (IDE integration)
        
- Rust is beginner-friendly and suitable for students or those learning systems concepts.
    
- Syntax comparison to C.
    

**Examples:**

**C:**

```c
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

**Rust:**

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

**Compiling & Running Programs:**

```shell
# C
$ gcc -o main main.c
$ ./main

# Rust
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
```

**Notes & Observations:**

- `rustup doc --book` opens the book locally.
    
- Rust ecosystem tools help maintain productivity while writing safe, systems-level code.
